### Unique In Order

-   Implement the function unique_in_order which takes as argument a sequence and returns a list of items without any elements with the same value next to each other and preserving the original order of elements.

**For example:**

```
uniqueInOrder('AAAABBBCCDAABBB') == ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'A', 'B']
uniqueInOrder('ABBCcAD')         == ['A', 'B', 'C', 'c', 'A', 'D']
uniqueInOrder([1,2,2,3,3])       == [1,2,3]

```

### The highest profit wins!

-   Story

Ben has a very simple idea to make some profit: he buys something and sells it again. Of course, this wouldn't give him any profit at all if he was simply to buy and sell it at the same price. Instead, he's going to buy it for the lowest possible price and sell it at the highest.

-   Task

Write a function that returns both the minimum and maximum number of the given list/array.

**Examples**

```
minMax([1,2,3,4,5])   == [1,5]
minMax([2334454,5])   == [5, 2334454]
minMax([1])           == [1, 1]

```
